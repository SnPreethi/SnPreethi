### About Me ðŸ’¬
<p align="justify">I am an undergraduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My academic journey taught me that intelligence isnâ€™t just about writing code â€” itâ€™s about constantly learning, unlearning, and evolving, just like we humans do. The curiosity behind the principles of intelligence and its implementation using computers pulled me into the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, NLP, and robotics, where machines begin to see, think, and act in ways that we do. Along this way of learning, Iâ€™ve fried CPUs and GPUs, and found joy in the chaos of experimentation.</p>
<p>Though AI now runs on neural networks, I still believe the strongest and most meaningful connections are human. Let's connect and explore more!</p>
